Needed to install pymunk==5.7.0 to have the game running
here's some quick commands

When you want to agents to fight one another (need to find a way to automate this)
python -m coderone.dungeon.main modular_agent/stand_still.py modular_agent/stand_still.py --headless 
Interactive mode:
python -m coderone.dungeon.main modular_agent/stand_still.py --interactive 

The input for the NN will be the game state (class object):
    game_state.is_over = Bool
    game_state.tick_number int (clock)
    game_state.size = tuple (x * y size)
    game_state.bombs = list of tuples 

The second input is the player state:
    player_state.id = int (irrelevant)
    player_state.ammo = int (current bomb count)
    player_state.hp = int (amount of hp)

each turn the agent (us) must return a move through next_move (action)
choices are: 
    '' = do nothing
    l = left
    r = right
    u = up
    d = down
    p = place a bomb
